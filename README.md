# altitrial
Altitude + Trials = altitrial

This is still very much a work in progress, we've only created the Git repo which includes an empty Unity project, set up the dependencies and added Travis-CI integration.


Altitrial will be a game where you ride around in a car, and try to jump from buidling to building to a certian end point. You'll do this using ramps and similar objects. You'll be able to play this game on Mac, Windows, Linux, iOS and Android. We are in high hopes (no pun intended) that this game is going to be really awesome.

We'll use Unity3D to make the game, blender to create 3D components and GitHub to sync. We'll get info from the Unity Docs and YouTube tutorials.

To achieve a great level of visual fidelity we'll need to create and use propper light shaders, and we'll leverage Unity's component system for smooth input handeling accross all platforms.
