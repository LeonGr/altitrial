Altitude + Trials = altitrial

This will be a game where you ride around on a dirt bike, and try to jump from buidling to building to a certian end point. You'll do this using ramps and similar objects. You'll be able to play this game on Mac, Windows, Linux, IOS and Android. The game is going to be pretty awesome, we hope. 

We'll use Unity3D to make the game, blender to create 3d components and GitHub to sync. We can get help from the unity documentation and tutorials on youtube.

This is still very much work in progress, we've only created the Git repo which includes empty Unity project, set up the dependencies and set up Travis-CI integration.

To get a good looking and working game we'll need to add components and a nice working controls.
