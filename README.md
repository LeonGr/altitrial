Altitude + Trials = altitrial

This will be a game where you ride around on a dirt bike, and try to jump from buidling to building to a certian end point. You'll do this using ramps and similar objects.  

This is still very much work in progress, we've only created the Git repo which includes empty Unity project, set up the dependencies and set up Travis-CI integration.
