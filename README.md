# altitrial
Altitude + Trials = altitrial

Altitrial will be a game where you ride around on a dirt bike, and try to jump from buidling to building to a certian end point. You'll do this using ramps and similar objects. You'll be able to play this game on Mac, Windows, Linux, iOS and Android. The game is going to be pretty awesome, we hope. 

We'll use Unity3D to make the game, blender to create 3D components and GitHub to sync. We'll get info from the Unity Docs and YouTube tutorials.

This is still very much work in progress, we've only created the Git repo which includes empty Unity project, set up the dependencies and set up Travis-CI integration.

To achieve a great level of visual fidelity we'll need to use propper light shaders, and we'll leverage Unity's component system for smooth input handeling accross all platforms.
