# altitrial
Altitude + Trials = altitrial


Altitrial is a game in which you use a car to fly through buildings.

We'll use Unity3D to make the game, blender to create 3D components and GitHub to sync. We'll get info from the Unity Docs and YouTube tutorials.

To achieve a great level of visual fidelity we'll need to create and use propper light shaders, and we'll leverage Unity's component system for smooth input handeling accross all platforms.
